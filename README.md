Medical Cost Prediction 

This is an interactive web app that predicts medical insurance charges based on user information such as age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region. The model was trained using a Random Forest Regressor. The model was trained on a public dataset and incorporates custom feature engineering like BMI categories and age group segmentation to improve prediction accuracy. The app is built using Streamlit, allowing users to interact with the model through a simple web interface.


Tools & Technologies Used:

- Python

- Pandas, NumPy – for data handling and preprocessing

- Matplotlib, Seaborn – data visualization during EDA and analysis

- Scikit-learn – for model training and feature scaling

- Streamlit – to build the interactive web app

- Plotly – for visualizing feature importance

- Joblib – to save and load the trained model


Features:

- User-friendly form to enter details like age, gender, BMI, number of children, smoking status, and region.

- Real-time medical charge prediction.

- Feature importance visualization using Plotly bar chart.
